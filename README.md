# Synced. 
#### Note: this is a product for syncing instead of collaborate working. 
The last syncing product you will ever use. 

Basic ideology: 

- Choose some folder and files from one device, sync them to other device**s** with each-specific path.
- Deleting any mapped file will cause the file on other devices being deleted as well. 
- Manual and auto sync is both supported. By the time writing this, I'm not sure whether auto sync will be released on time or not, but I can guarantee that it will come. 
- Please ensure that before syncing, the mapped file on other devices DID NOT CHANGE. Again, this is not a collaborate working product, but a syncing product.
